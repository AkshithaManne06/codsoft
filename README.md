This document describes a simple Python calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program takes two numbers and an operation choice from the user and Short Documentation:
Purpose:
The purpose of this calculator program is to allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. The program prompts the user to enter the numbers and the operation they wish to perform, calculates the result, and then displays the output.

How It Works:
User Input:

The program asks the user for two numbers (num1 and num2) and an arithmetic operation (such as add, subtract, multiply, or divide).
These inputs are taken via the input() function, which collects the userâ€™s response.
Function to Perform Operations:

The calculator function is defined to handle four basic operations:
Addition (add): Adds the two numbers.
Subtraction (subtract): Subtracts the second number from the first number.
Multiplication (multiply): Multiplies the two numbers.
Division (divide): Divides the first number by the second, with a check to avoid division by zero.
If an invalid operation is entered, the program returns "Invalid operation".
Calculation:

The program calls the calculator function with the user-provided values (num1, num2, operation).
The function performs the relevant operation and returns the result.
Output:

The program displays the result of the operation using the print() function. If division by zero is attempted, an error message ("Error: Division by zero!") is shown.
Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid operation or tries to divide by zero, the program will handle these errors and display an appropriate message.
User-Friendly Interaction: Prompts the user for inputs and clearly displays the results.
Code Overview:
Function Definition:

The function calculator(num1, num2, operation) defines the logic for each arithmetic operation. It uses a series of if-elif conditions to determine which operation to perform.
Input Handling:

num1 and num2 are converted to floats to allow decimal numbers. The operation is converted to lowercase using .lower() to ensure the program is case-insensitive.
Calculation and Output:

The function returns the result of the calculation or an error message if there is an issue. The result is then displayed to the user.
Possible Enhancements:
Repetition: You could modify the program to perform multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
Input Validation: The program could be enhanced by checking that the user inputs numbers and a valid operation.
Conclusion:
This simple calculator program demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python. It includes basic error handling and provides a simple, interactive user interface. This is a great starting point for building more advanced calculators or similar applications.
